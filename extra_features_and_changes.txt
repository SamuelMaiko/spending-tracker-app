For the analytics page, the filters should be moved from the app bar to above the summary cards to provide more room because we are about to add additional filters,
 then another filter should be added for "weekly" and "monthly" which will default to "weekly".

(ensure any new data added during the updates i.e new fields or models are corrected integrated well with firebase i.e during sync or storing in local db after user login)

 For monthly it is already handled as that is hte current data. When monthly is selected, the filter for months
  will be visibly, when weekly is selected the months filter will change to weeks showing e.g "This week", "last week",
   "Sep 2025 wk 4" (only show last 4 weeks similar to the months one and should be a modal sheet from the bottom)



when the monthly filter is on, we'll show all the data in the analytics page except the "Daily spending" chart.
When it is weekly, we'll show everything there including the "Monthly Spending Trend" chart but the data will change to match weeks

also for the monthly spending trend chart, please also show the value when one clicks on the bar and instead of e.g instead 1.5k show 1500

another feature we'll add is "weekly spending limit"
we should also introduce another model to manage the storing of weekly targets, whereby is stores the week start and end and the value set

a user can view and edit the week targets in a page linked in the app's settings page, they can only edit the current week's target, in the
target card also show by how much the user went aboard or below the limit e.g +200, -150 you get me


then now in the analytics page, only in the weekly filter add another summary card below the other stats cards but above the charts
showing the weekly target and the amount spent so far and by how much the user is above or below the target. It should take the whole width






The transactions page should enable filtering by:
- status i.e "uncategorized", "All"
- also by "Today", "Yesterday", "All" and should follow the same way and the
 analytics does it i.e using a modal sheet unlike dropdowns. Default to "Today"
- by category 


The wallets page should not have a back icon in the app but should be a normal page like the dashboard i.e the navbar is still visible on it and the title on the app bar to resemble that of the transactions page i.e a title and description

for the navbar,the changes look fine but please replace the items there my items in the navbar i.e Dashboard, Transactions, Analytics, Profile and their icons 
The icon at the center should not be a plus but one that represents wallets. The navbar should use the same shade of blue used for hte app bar
